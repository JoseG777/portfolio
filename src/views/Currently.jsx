      <h2>SEO Tech Developer Program</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently participating in the SEO Tech Developer Program, an intensive, free immersion program designed to propel first-year and sophomore Black, Latinx, and Native American computer science and software engineering students to the next level. This program includes a paid six-week summer residency where participants receive a $6,000 stipend.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program provides comprehensive training and mentoring to help students compete for entry-level tech roles at top companies. We cover a variety of topics, including APIs, JSON, Databases, SQL, Unit Testing, Development Pipelines, Cyber Security, Data Engineering, Front End Technologies, Web App Security, UI/UX Design, Agile and Scrum, DevOps, and Cloud Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the technical training, the program offers resources for interview preparation, such as mock interviews, mentoring, tutoring, and interviewing bootcamps, with the aim of securing internships and full-time positions at partner companies.
