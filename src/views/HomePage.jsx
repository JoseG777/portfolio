      <h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
      <h2>My name is Jose Guzman and I'm currently a rising junior at Hunter College pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.</h2>
      <p>
        I have a strong interest in backend engineering and am quite comfortable setting up the frontend, though design is my weak point. I find a lot of fulfillment in completing projects, particularly those that involve complex problem-solving and the implementation of efficient, scalable solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've developed proficiency in languages such as C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. I also have experience with frameworks like React.js, Vue.js, Express.js, Node.js, and Flask. My toolkit includes Git/GitHub, Postman, MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase, VS Code, Google Cloud, and Google Lighthouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course there's always room for improvement so I try to keep my skills fresh by working on projects, practicing data structures and algorithms, and keeping up with new technologies!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about software engineering and enjoy the process of bringing ideas to life through code. The challenges and continuous learning opportunities in this field keep me motivated and engaged.
      </p>

        Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas!
